1. unity_build: add all cpp files into one cpp file using #include
example:
a.cpp
a.hpp
b.cpp
b.hpp
....

adding unity_build_file.cpp which looks like:
#include "a.cpp"
#include "b.cpp"
...

this solves the problem precompiled header by only linking
once as all compiliation is done in a single file. and allows
for better optimizations as some functions might get inlined
better.


2. remove exception and rtti
make binary much smaller.

3. set target archtiectue -mcpu=native/arch:ARMv7VE/....
 
4. extern template to remove multiple inisitiation (unity build might remove this)


5. precompiled header
