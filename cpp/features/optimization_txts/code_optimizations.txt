1. use constexpr to move logic into build time

2. const everything u can, const variables const memeber function 

3. no except, good for doc to user and optimization for compiler, RISKY
if it throws u are fucked, compiler a lot of time can deduct this itself

4. in cpp file use static for free private function and globals for better linkages and optimizations

5. attribute [[no_return]] for functions that while true / always throw / exit
